# ConFusion

This is a learning project from "Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: Angular" in Coursera by Prof. Jogesh K. Muppala from HKUST.

This course concentrates mainly on Javascript based front-end frameworks, and in particular the Angular framework (Currently Ver. 6.x). This course will use Typescript for developing Angular application. Typescript features will be introduced in the context of Angular as part of the exercises. You will also get an introduction to the use of Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout for responsive UI design. You will be introduced to various aspects of Angular including components, directives and services. You will learn about data binding, Angular router and its use for developing single-page applications. You will also learn about designing both template-driven forms and reactive forms. A quick introduction to Observables, reactive programming and RxJS in the context of Angular is included. You will then learn about Angular support for client-server communication through the HTTP client and the use of REST API on the server side. A quick tour through Angular animation support and Angular testing rounds off the course. You must have either completed the previous course in the specialization on Bootstrap 4, or have a working knowledge of front end web-UI frameworks to be able to navigate this course. Also a good working knowledge of JavaScript, especially ES 5 is strongly recommended.

At the end of this course you will:

- Be familiar with client-side Javascript frameworks and the Angular framework
- Be able to implement single page applications in Angular
- Be able to use various Angular features including directives, components and services
- Be able to implement a functional front-end web application using Angular
- Be able to use Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout for designing responsive Angular applications
- Be able to use Observables and RxJS in the context of Angular applications

### This is Course 1 of 5 in the "Full Stack Web and Multiplatform Mobile App Development" Specialization.
Learn front-end and hybrid mobile development, with server-side support, for implementing a multi-platform solution.
The first two courses in this Specialization cover front-end frameworks: Bootstrap 4 and Angular. You’ll also learn to create hybrid mobile applications, using the Ionic framework, Cordova and NativeScript. On the server side, you’ll learn to implement NoSQL databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment and Express framework, and communicate to the client side through a RESTful API. Learners enrolling in this Specialization are expected to have prior working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Ideally learners should complete the courses in the specified sequence. It is strongly recommended that the Angular course be completed before proceeding with the Ionic and Cordova and/or the NativeScript course.
